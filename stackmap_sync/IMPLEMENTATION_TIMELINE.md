- [ ] Implement conflict resolution UI
- [ ] Add error handling displays
- [ ] Create loading states

### Day 21: Platform Testing
- [ ] Test on iOS devices
- [ ] Test on Android devices
- [ ] Test on web browsers
- [ ] Fix platform-specific issues

**Milestone 3: Complete UI integration**

## Week 4: Testing & Optimization (Days 22-28)

### Day 22-23: End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Test new device setup
- [ ] Test joining existing sync
- [ ] Test conflict scenarios
- [ ] Test offline/online transitions

### Day 24-25: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Test with large datasets
- [ ] Optimize sync frequency
- [ ] Test incremental sync
- [ ] Monitor bandwidth usage

### Day 26-27: Edge Cases
- [ ] Test network failures
- [ ] Test data corruption recovery
- [ ] Test concurrent modifications
- [ ] Test device limits

### Day 28: Documentation & Launch
- [ ] Update user documentation
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Final security review
- [ ] Deploy to production

**Milestone 4: Production-ready sync feature**

## Post-Launch Tasks (Week 5+)

### Monitoring (Ongoing)
- Monitor error logs
- Track sync success rates
- Monitor server resources
- Gather user feedback

### Enhancements (Future)
- WebSocket relay for QR pairing
- Selective sync options
- Sync analytics dashboard
- Multi-language support

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Database Performance**
   - Solution: Add indexes, optimize queries
   - Fallback: Implement caching layer

2. **Encryption Compatibility**
   - Solution: Extensive cross-platform testing
   - Fallback: Provide migration tools

3. **Network Reliability**
   - Solution: Robust retry logic
   - Fallback: Manual sync button

### Timeline Risks
1. **Delays in Testing**
   - Buffer: Each week has 1 day buffer
   - Solution: Parallel testing where possible

2. **Platform-Specific Issues**
   - Buffer: Day 21 for platform fixes
   - Solution: Early platform testing

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 99% sync success rate
- [ ] <2 second sync time for typical data
- [ ] Zero data loss in conflict resolution
- [ ] 100% encryption coverage

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] <3 taps to enable sync
- [ ] Clear error messages
- [ ] Intuitive conflict resolution
- [ ] Visible sync status

## Resources Required

### Development
- 1 Full-stack developer (4 weeks)
- 1 QA tester (weeks 3-4)
- Server resources for testing

### Infrastructure
- Production server with PHP/MySQL
- HTTPS certificate
- Monitoring service
- Backup solution

## Communication Plan

### Weekly Updates
- Monday: Week goals
- Wednesday: Progress check
- Friday: Issues and blockers

### Stakeholder Reviews
